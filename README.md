CTypes wrapper for the Sitronix VL53L5CX Ultra-light Driver- C source mirror can be found at https://github.com/ST-mirror/VL53L5CX_ULD_driver/tree/lite/en

# Prerequisites

You must enable:

* i2c `sudo raspi-config nonint do_i2c 0`

If you're not using any i2c devices for which 400KHz is out of range (trackball), you might also want to increase your i2c baud rate.

VL53L5CX requires a firmware upload on startup, and it's *slow*. Add a baudrate to the i2c line in `/boot/config.txt` to speed it up:

```
dtparam=i2c_arm=on,i2c_arm_baudrate=400000
```

Note: The default baudrate is 200000 (200KHz) and a typical maximum for most devices is 400000 (400KHz), but you can also use 1000000 (1MHz) if you're just driving VL53L5CX sensors.

# Installing

* Just run `pip3 install vl53l5cx-ctypes`

In some cases you may need to use `sudo` or install pip with: `sudo apt install python3-pip`

# Ranging frequency

To achieve the maximum of 15 Hz, some data has to be removed from the stream.
You can do this by forking this wrapper and editing `library/platform.h` and `library/vl53l5cx_ctypes/__init__.py` to your needs.
Use this fork edit as an example: `https://github.com/pimoroni/vl53l5cx-python/compare/dev...HylkeJellema:vl53l5cx-python-RangeOnly:dev`
